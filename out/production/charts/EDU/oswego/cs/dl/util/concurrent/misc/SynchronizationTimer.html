</DL>

<P>
    This program records times for various fine-grained synchronization
    schemes, and provides some ways of measuring them over different
    context parameters.

<p>
    Quick start:
<ol>
    <li>javac -d <em>base of some CLASSPATH</em> *.java <br>
        You'll need Swing (JFC). (This
        program currently imports the javax.swing versions.
        You can edit imports to instead use other versions.)
    <li>java EDU.oswego.cs.dl.util.concurrent.misc.SynchronizationTimer <br>
    <li> Click<em> start</em>.
        Clicking <em>stop</em> cancels the run. Cancellation can take
        a while when there are a lot of threads.
    <li>For more explanation about tested classes, see
        <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">Documentation for
            util.concurrent</a>
</ol>

<p>
    Synchronization schemes are tested around implementations and
    subclasses of <code>RNG</code>, which is just a hacked random
    number generator class. Objects of this class have just enough
    state and require just enough computation to be reasonable minimal
    targets. (Additionally, random numbers are needed a lot in these
    kinds of time tests, so basing them on objects that produce random
    numbers is convenient.) Computation of each random number is
    padded a bit with an adjustable compute loop running a random
    number of times to avoid getting schedulers locked into
    uninteresting patterns.

<p>
    Each iteration of each test ultimately somehow calls
    the random number generation
    method of an RNG. The time listed is the average time it took to do
    one iteration, in microseconds. These are just based on wallclock
    time (System.currentTimeMillis()). Thread
    construction time is <em>NOT</em> included in these times.
    In tests with many threads, construction and other bookkeeping
    can take longer than the tests themselves.

<p>
    Results are listed in a table, and optionally printed on standard output.
    You can redirect standard output to save to a file.

<p>
    The total amount of ``real'' computation reported in each cell is
    the same. Thus, the unobtainably ideal pattern of results would be
    for every cell of the table to be the same (and very small).

<p>
    A thread pool (PooledExecutor) is used to manage the threads used in
    test runs. The current number of active threads is indicated in
    the panel. It should normally be at most three plus the number of threads used in the
    indicated test column (there are at most three overhead threads per run), although
    it may transiently climb, and is larger in those tests that
    generate their own internal threads (for example ThreadedExceutor). If the
    indicated size fails to return to zero within about 10 seconds of
    either hitting stop
    or the end of a run, you may have a
    problem with interruption handling on your Java VM.

<p>
    This program cannot
    tell you how busy your computer is while running tests.
    You can run a utility program (for
    example <code>perfmeter</code> or <code>top</code> on unix)
    alongside this program
    to find out.

<p>
    A number of control parameters can be changed at any time.
    Most combinations of parameter settings create contexts
    that are completely unrepresentative of those seen in practical
    applications. However, they can be set to provide rough analogs of
    real applications, and the results used as rough guesses about
    performance impact. Also, do not be too upset about slow
    performance on tests representing situations
    that would never occur in practice.

<p>

    You can control parameters by clicking any of the following,
    at any time. (You can even change parameters
    while tests are running, in which case they will take
    effect as soon as possible. Most controls momentarily stall
    while test objects and threads are being constructed, to avoid
    inconsistencies during test runs.)
<dl>

    <dt> Number of threads

    <dd> Controls concurrency. The indicated number of threads are
        started simultaneously and then waited out.

    <dt>Contention.

    <dd>Percent sharing among threads. Zero percent means that each
        thread has its own RNG object, so there is no
        interference among threads. The zero
        percent case thus shows the cost of synchronization mechanics that
        happen to never be needed.
        100 percent sharing means that all
        threads call methods on the same object, so each thread will have to
        wait until the RNG objects are not being used by others.
        In between is in between: Only the given percentage of calls are
        made to shared RNG objects; others are to unshared.
        Contention in classes that use Channels works slightly differently:
        The Channels are shared, not the base RNG objects. (Another way
        of looking at it is that tests demonstrate effects of multiple
        producers and consumers on the same channel.)

    <dt>Classes
    <dd>You can choose to only test the indicated classes. You can
        probably figure out how to add more classes to run yourself.

    <dt>Calls per thread per test

    <dd>Specifies number of iterations per thread per test. The listed
        times are averages over these iterations. The default seems to
        provide precise enough values for informal testing purposes.
        You should expect to see a fair amount of variation across
        repeated runs.
        If you get zeroes printed in any cell, this means that the
        test ran too fast to measure in milleconds, so you should increase the
        iterations value.

    <dt> Computations per call

    <dd>Specifies length of each call by setting an internal looping
        parameter inside each RNG object. Shorter calls lead to shorter
        times between synchronization measures. Longer calls, along with
        high contention can be used to force timeouts to occur.

    <dt> Iterations per barrier.

    <dd> Specifies the number of iterations performed by each thread until
        a synchronization barrier is forced with other threads, forcing
        it to wait for other threads to reach the same number of iterations. This
        controls the amount of interaction (versus contention) among threads.
        Setting to a value greater than the number of iterations per test
        effectively disables barriers.

    <dt> Threads per barrier

    <dd> Specifies how many threads are forced to synchronize at each
        barrier point. Greater numbers cause more threads to wait for each
        other at barriers. Setting to 1 means that a thread only has to
        wait for itself, which means not to wait at all.

    <dt>Lock mode

    <dd>For classes that support it, this controls whether mutual
        exclusion waits are done via standard blocking synchronization, or
        a loop repeatedly calling a timed wait.

    <dt>Producer mode

    <dd>For classes that support it, this controls whether producers
        perform blocking puts versus loops repeatedly calling offer.

    <dt>Consumer mode

    <dd>For classes that support it, this controls whether consumers
        perform blocking takes versus loops repeatedly calling poll.

    <dt> Timeouts

    <dd> Specifies the duration of timeouts used in timeout mode. A
        value of zero results in pure spin-loops.

    <dt>Producer/consumer rates.

    <dd>For tests involving producer/consumer pairs, this controls
        whether the producer is much faster, about the same speed, or much
        slower than the consumer. This is implemented by having the
        producer do all, half, or none of the actual calls to update, in
        addition to adding elements to channel.

    <dt>Buffer capacity

    <dd>For tests involving finite capacity
        buffers, this controls maximum buffer size.

</dl>

<p>
    To scaffold all this, the RNG class is defined in
    layers. Each RNG has internal non-public methods that do the actual
    computation, and public methods that call the internal ones. The
    particular classes run in tests might change over time, but
    currently includes the following general kinds:

<dl>


    <dt> Using built-in synchronization
    <dd> Versions of RNG classes that use (or don't use)
        synchronized methods and/or blocks. Also some tests of
        simple SynchronizedVariables. Tests that would not
        be thread-safe are not run when there is more than one
        thread and non-zero contention.


    <dt> Using <code>Sync</code> classes as locks
    <dd> Classes protecting public methods via Semaphores, mutexes, etc.
        In each case, the outer public methods delegate actions to
        another RNG object, surrounded by acquire/release/etc. The
        class called SDelegated does this using builtin
        synchronization rather than Sync locks
        so might be a useful comparison.

    <dt> Using Channels
    <dd> These classes work a little bit differently than the others.
        Each test arranges that half of the threads behave as producers,
        and half as consumers. Each test iteration puts/takes an RNG object
        through a channel before or after executing its update
        method. When the number of threads is one, each producer
        simply consumers its own object. Some Channels (notably
        SynchronousChannels) cannot be used with only one thread,
        in which case the test is skipped.

    <dt> Using Executors
    <dd> These classes arrange for each RNG update to occur
        as an executable command. Each test iteration passes a
        command to an Executor, which eventually executes it.
        Execution is overlapped: Each iteration starts a new
        command, and then waits for the previous command to complete.

</dl>

<p>

    The test code is ugly; it has just evolved over the years. Sorry.
