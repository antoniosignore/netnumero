<h1>Task framework demo programs</h1>

The programs in this directory include ones that I've used to test
and experiment with the task framework. You may also find
them useful as demonstrations of various constructions and
techniques that can be used with Tasks. However, most of
these programs are not themselves particularly useful, and
have not been constructed or documented with any concern for reuse
or extensibility. They are not properly packaged (i.e., they
do not declare to be in any package). They can be compiled
via: <code>javac *.java</code>

<p>
    These programs are intended to show interesting variations in
    techniques, and do not necessarily demonstrate optimal performance.
    But some of the programs have been adapted from other common demo
    and benchmark programs used in parallel processing packages. To
    make comparisons with them fairer, I've usually tried to keep
    faithful to original quirks. (In fact a few were constructed by
    taking original C code and mangling it until javac declared that it
    was legal java code :-)

<p>

<p>
    All of the programs are run by:
  <pre>java Prog #threads [any other arguments]
  </pre>
where <code>#threads</code> is the number of threads to establish in
a TaskGroupRunner that runs the tasks. All of the programs print out
ThreadGroup.stats(), normally at the ends of their runs. Some of
the programs do not bother printing out any further results. Some
programs, at some parameter settings deal with huge arrays and
matrices that require a lot of memory, so you might need to use
<code>-Xmx</code> switches; for example <code>-Xmx64m</code> to use
a maximum of 64Mbytes of memory.

<dl>
    <dt><a href="Fib.java">Fib</a> #threads number [sequential-threshold]
    <dd>A fibonacci program similar to the one listed in the
        documentation for the Task
        class. Invoke with an number to compute the fibonacci number
        for. For example <code>java Fib 2 35</code> computes the 35th
        fibonacci number with two threads. The optional sequential
        threshold value controls the argument size under which it
        uses a sequential version of fib (default is 0, meaning it
        never does). See also <a href="FibVCB.java">FibVCB</a>, a
        callback-based version with same usage parameters.
        <p>

            <dt><a href="MatrixMultiply.java">MatrixMultiply</a> #threads matrix-size granularity
            <dd>A parallel divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication.
                The matrix size must be a power of two. The granularity
                controls the matrix size under which it stops recursively generating
                parallel tasks and performs a sequential multiply. It must
                also be a power of two and be at least 2. Default if not given is 16.
                <p>

                    <dt><a href="Jacobi.java">Jacobi</a> #threads matrix-size
                        max-iterations granularity
                    <dd> Performs Jacobi iteration of a mesh
                        of matrix-size for either max-iterations or until converged. For
                        demonstration, it is just applied to a square matrix of side
                        matrix-size with all zeroes in the interior and all ones along
                        edges. Default granularity if not given is 256 cells. See also <a
                                href="BarrierJacobi.java">BarrierJacobi</a>, a different
                        implementation using cyclic barriers (but not Tasks). It takes the
                        same parameters except there is no first #threads argument.
                        <p>

                            <dt><a href="Heat.java">Heat</a> #threads 0-4
                            <dd>A standard parallel processing benchmark program that
                                simulates heat diffusion across a mesh.
                                The argument
                                between 0 and 4 just selects among sets of parameter settings
                                that you can find more about by reading the code.
                                <p>

                                    <dt><a href="LU.java">LU</a> #threads matrix-size #runs
                                    <dd>LU matrix decomposition of randomly filled matrix.
                                        The matrix size must be
                                        a power of two, and at least 16. A granularity constant
                                        of 16 is built-in as a compile-time final constant.
                                        The optional #runs parameter optionally repeats the
                                        compuation on a new matrix.
                                        <p>


                                            <dt><a href="Integrate.java">Integrate</a> #threads low high e
                                            <dd>Computes integrals using recursive Gaussian Quadrature. A
                                                sample function to integrate (the sum of <code>(2*i-1)*power(x,
                                                    (2*i-1))</code>) for odd values of i up through e) is
                                                pre-loaded. Call with lower and upper bounds. The <code>e</code>
                                                value is a parameter of the function. Higher values cause the
                                                function to both be slower to compute and take more iterations
                                                (subdivisions) for its integral to converge. If not given, it
                                                defaults to 5. For example, one reasonable set of test parameters
                                                is: <code> java Integrate 4 1 48 5</code>.

    <dd>A demo showing that you can, but probably shouldn't, use
        Tasks for classic producer-consumer programs. It sets up varying
        number of producer and consumer tasks, each operating on
        selected buffer sizes. If any producer cannot put, or consumer
        cannot take, it creates a whole new task to take over where
        it left off, starts it, and terminates. While this process
        cannot infinitely livelock, it can come pretty close.
