<H2>Package description: <code>TradingStrategies</code></H2>

<p>This package defines trading strategies trading in one or more assets.
    Several concrete strategies are implemented most importantly option hedging
    strategies (<code>StrategyDeltaHedging</code>) using any one of the hedge
    weights defined in the class <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>Each trading strategy has a method to return the discounted gains from
    trading as a random variable and a more complete set of statistics as a
    random vector. In this way means, variances and histograms can all be
    computed easily by calling the respective methods in the class
    <code>RandomVariable</code> (<code>RandomVector</code>).</p>
