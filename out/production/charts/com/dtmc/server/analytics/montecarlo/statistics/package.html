<H2>Package description: <code>Statistics</code></H2>

<p>This is the main package defining <code>RandomVariables</code> and
    <code>RandomVectors</code>. Each of these classes becomes concrete by defining
    a single abstract method <code>getValue(int t)</code> intepreted as the next
    draw from the underlying distribution conditioned on all information available
    at time <code>t</code>. Typically this information is the state of the path
    <code>s&#949;[0,t]-&gt X(s)</code> of some stochastic process
    <code>X</code> up to time <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>Random variables and vectors have a variety of methods to compute statistics
    associated with the underlying distribution. Histograms are also supported.
    Random vectors are necessary if we have to deal with correlations and have a
    method to compute the covariation matrix. One call to the underlying stochastic
    mechanism produces the next sample for each coordinate. Separate random
    variables make separate calls to the underlying stochastic mechanism and thus
    appear to be independent.</p>

<p>There is also a utility class <code>FinMath</code> containing some
    static methods which are useful in financial mathematics: the Black-Scholes
    formula, solving for implied volatlities, cumulative normal and inverse
    cumulative normal distribution function etc.</p>

<p>The various <code>data source</code> classes make the connection to the
    <code>jas</code> (java analyis studio) library to support the computation
    and display of histograms.</p>
