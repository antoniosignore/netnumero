Defines hedges for both options on single assets and options on baskets as
particular trading strategies. Delta hedges are also defined. Recall that
delta hedges need not use classical (analytic, instantaneous) deltas.
Instead the term <i>delta hedge</i> refers to any hedge using one of the 6
types of hedge weights which are implemented. See {@link Market.Flag} for
the flags which identify the various hedge weights (deltas).
