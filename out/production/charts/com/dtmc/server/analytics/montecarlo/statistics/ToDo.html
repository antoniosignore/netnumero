<H3>Class Random</H3>

The basic routine <code>Random.STN()</code> which generates all the standard
normal increments driving every dynamics except QMC-dynamics is still Box-Muller
based. Switch to Inverse Normal CDF.

<H3>Classes RandomVariable, RandomVector</H3>

Having methods reporting computational progress to a progress bar which is a
parameter is only useful if the computation is reported to some GUI containing
the progress bar. It would have been better if a separate window is opened up
for the progress bar. We can still do this with minimal effort by adding
methods of the type:
<br>
<br>
<code>
    public double expectation(int t, int N, boolean progressReport, String messsage)<br>
    {<br>
    .....if(progressReport)<br>
    .....{<br>
    ..........allocate window with a jProgressBar jPgrBar;<br>
    ..........expectation(t,N,jPgrBar);<br>
    .....}<br>
    .....else{ expectation(t,N); }<br>
    }<br>
</code>
<br>
<br>
The message string identifies the computation and indicates that it can be
killed by closing the window. Copy the Window allocation code from the class
<code>LoopStatus</code>
For each method add a stand alone progress report enabled version.
