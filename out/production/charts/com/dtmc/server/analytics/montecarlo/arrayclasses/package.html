<H2>ArrayClasses package description.</H2>

<p>This package contains several two and three dimensional ragged array structures
    (triangular matrices and arrays of triangular matrices).</p>

<p><b>Libor process.</b>
    The intended domain of application is the Libor process.
    To simulate the time step <code>T_t-&gt T_{t+1}</code> of the forward Libors
    we need the matrix <code>CV[t]</code> with entries
</p>
<center>
    <code>
        CV[t]_ij=int_{T_t}^{T_{t+1}}sigma_i(s)sigma_j(s)rho_ijds
    </code>
</center>
</p>

<p>and its Cholesky root <code>L[t]</code>. These matrices are path
    independent and so path simulation can be sped up by storing them in the
    <code>LiborProcess</code> object. Since <code>L[t]</code> is lower
    triangular and <code>CV[t]</code> is symmetric we have the option to store
    the lower triangular half of these matrices only.</p>

<p>However in the simulation of the time steps the natural index range
    for the matrix entries is not zero based. Moreover matrix multiplication
    could be used to formulate the time step in vector form. A path simulation
    will go through the sequence of these matrices in a three dimensional loop
    and is consequently computationally intensive. Speed is thus of the utmost
    importance.</p>

<p>A desire to store the sequence of these matrices in a custom data structure
    (rather than a raw java array) results from various sources:

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of matrix algebra and predefined matrix packages.</li>
    <li>The need to use indices not starting at zero and hence the desire to
        let accessor functions do the shift of index values to zero based
        arrays.
    </li>
    <li>The idea that one dimensional contiguous memory allocation might improve
        data flow beween memory and L2-cache. Index arithmetic then has to be
        used to introduce the matrix structure.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The finding of (naive) experiments ({@link Examples.Array.ArrayTiming})
    is that raw java arrays provide the best performance.
    Contiguous memory allocation has very little beneficial effect, even the akward
    index arithmetic such as in the class {@link ArrayClasses.UTRContiguousArray})
    does not impose a significant penalty but <strong>accessor function calls add
        significant overhead</strong>. Quite possibly accessor functions obscure the
    way in which loops traverse memory so compiler optimizations are no longer possible.
</p>

<p>Other schemes such as storing the base address (reference) of a the subarray
    which is entered by a loop before the loop is entered and so reducing index
    calculations in the loop also has no benficial effect and can even
    be harmful.</p>

<p>However reducing the size of the data has a significant effect.
    For example if triangular matrices are stored as square matrices with zeroes
    (approximately doubling the size) speed slows down by a factor of nearly two.
    This happens even if only the nonzero entries are accessed and both the smaller
    and larger structures are far too large to fit in the L2-cache.
</p>

<p>The upshot is that raw java arrays and straightforward loops provide the
    fastest performance and the size of these arrays should be kept as small as
    the problem allows.</p>

<p>Consequently the structures {@link ArrayClasses.LTRMatrixArray} and
    {@link ArrayClasses.UTRMatrixArray} have been chosen to implement the above
    mentioned matrix sequences in the <code>LiborProcess</code>, see
    {@link Libor.LiborProcess.FactorLoading}).
    The classes {@link ArrayClasses.LowerTriangularArray} and
    {@link ArrayClasses.UpperTriangularArray}
    are also used in the {@link Libor.LiborProcess}.
    The other classes are here merely for speed experiments.</p>

<p><b>Loops should follow the layout of arrays in memory:</b>
    two dimensional java arrays <code>A</code> which are allocated with repeated
    <code>new</code> are layered into memory row by row.
    Make sure each loop traverses the array in the same
    manner. In other words assume <code>A</code> was allocated as</p>

<p>
    <code>
        double[][] A=new double[n][]; <br>
        for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) A[i]=new double[n];
    </code>
</p>
then do
<p>
    <code>
        for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++)<br>
        for(int j=0;j&lt;n;j++){ ...A[i][j]...}
    </code>
</p>
but do <strong>not</strong> do
<p>
    <code>
        for(int j=0;j&lt;n;j++)<br>
        for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++){ ...A[i][j]...}
    </code>
</p>

<p>even if this corresponds to the natural order of the problem.
    Just think about how the second loop jumps around in memory and how blocks will
    be moved back and forth from memory to the cache with minimal use of the data
    in the block.</p>
