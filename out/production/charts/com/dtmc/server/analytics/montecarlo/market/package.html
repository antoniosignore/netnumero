In this package the various single or multi asset markets are introduced.
In general we are limited to deterministic volatility and constant correlation
of returns. Remember that we do not carry the riskless bond as an asset since
we are working with <i>discounted</i> prices, that is, the riskless bond is
the numeraire asset. Thus markets consisting of a single asset do make sense.
