<H2>Package description: <code>RandomVariables</code></H2>

<p>This class implements several concrete examples of
    <code>RandomVariables</code>. The implementation is straightforward using the
    probability distributions from the package <code>com.vodafone.global.ngp.editorial.server.cern.jet.random</code> in
    the
    <a href=http://tilde-hoschek.home.cern.ch/~hoschek/colt/V1.0.1/doc/overview-summary.html>colt</a>
    library.</p>

<p>These are provided as examples for newcomers to play around with. Each
    random variable has a <code>main</code> method which displays both a smoothed
    and nonsmoothed histogram of the distribution underlying the random variable.
</p>

<p>The main focus of this library is on random variables which are functionals
    of the path of a stochastic process. Generally the distribution of such a
    random variable will not be known.</p>
