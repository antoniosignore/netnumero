<H2>Package description: <code>Examples</code></H2>

This package contains a variety of programs illustrating the use of the
library interfaces. Some of these have no other than this purpose.
Others are some simulations which hopefully are of independent interest.
Please note that many classes also have <code>main</code> methods which
provide further examples which illustrate the use of the library.
