<p>A trigger observes the price path of an asset and triggers an event if a
    certain condition is has been met since the last time the event was triggered
    (for example if the asset price has moved 10% up or down). The intended
    application is as a signal to initiate the next trade in a trading strategy.
    The most obvious triggers are implemented:
<ul>
    <li><code>NullTrigger</code> event is triggered only at the horizon.</li>
    <li><code>TriggerPeriodic</code> event is triggered in equal time intervals.
    </li>
    <li><code>TriggerOnPercentChange</code> event is triggered as soon as the asset
        price has moved a set percentage.
    </li>
</ul>
