<H2>Package description: <code>QuasiRandom</code></H2>

<p>The Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) package. Contains implementations of the
    Halton, Sobol and Niederreiter-Xing generator in various dimensions:
<ul>
    <li><i>Halton:</i> unlimited (but useless in high dimensions)</li>
    <li><i>Sobol:</i> up to dimension 300 but easily extended if more primitive
        polynomials modulo two are obtained (see Peter Jaeckels book <i>Monte Carlo
            Methods in Finance</i> which comes with a disk containing millions of
        primitive polynomials, only one is needed for each dimension).
    </li>
    <li><i>Niederrreiter-Xing:</i> up to dimension 20. Lowest L2-discrepancy in each
        dimension but there is no easy way to extend this to higher dimensions.
    </li>
</ul>
Each low discrepancy sequence has 2 methods to compute its L2-discrepancy,
straightforward (non optimized) algorithms are used. This means that this is
very slow if the number of low discrepancy points is large.
</p>

<p>There are also some nasty test integrals (very narrow and tall spikes
    all integrating to one in several dimensions) and a class to plot projections
    of low discrepancy points onto two dimensional coordinate parallel subspaces
    of the space in which the sequence lives.</p>
