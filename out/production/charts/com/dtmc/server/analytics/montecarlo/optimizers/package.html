<H2>Package desription: <code>Optimizers</code></H2>

<p>This package contains a number of optimizers coded out of Numerical Recipes
    as quickly as possible and without much thought or devotion. If this works
    for you be thankful. Multidimensional optimization is a nontrivial undertaking
    and a high quality implementation requires a significant amount of effort and
    expertise. I have no expertise in this field.</p>

<p>Here we have only a single application in mind: parameter optimization
    for exercise triggers used to price Bermudan style options. Miraculously
    the code which we have here can do that.</p>
