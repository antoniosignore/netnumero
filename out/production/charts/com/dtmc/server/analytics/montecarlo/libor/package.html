<H2>Package description: <code>Libor</code></H2>

<!-- Greek characters mu="&#03BC", nu="&#03BD" -->

<p>Implementation of the Libor Market Model (LMM) with deterministic forward
    Libor volatilities and constant correlations and some basic Libor derivatives.
    The theory behind the LMM cannot be adequately represented in the javadoc
    format. The document <i>LiborProcess.ps</i> contains all the details.
</p>

<p>This implementation is intended to be used for theoretical investigations
    and cannot in its present form be used for the actual pricing
    of Libor derivatives. There is no routine which builds an initial term structure
    of forward Libors or which extracts a tenor structure from actual dates and
    market conventions. You will have to supply these if you want to use the model
    in this way:</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> This code is fragile and has not nearly been tested enough.
    It is intended to provide an infrastructure for users to run their own
    experiments and supply them with ideas and examples. The target audience are
    programmers interested enough to read the source code and run
    tests. One hopes that a bug manifests itself by a simple crash. But what if
    it is more subtle resulting in a pricing error?
    Note the complete lack of warranty governing this package.
